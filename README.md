# CTF Writeups Repository

Welcome to my repository of writeups for various Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges!
Here, I will be documenting the solutions used to solve different CTF tasks from a variety of competitions.

## About

This repository is designed to serve as a personal knowledge base and to share insights with the wider security and CTF community.
Each folder within this repository will correspond to a different CTF event or individual challenge, containing writeups and any associated scripts I used during the process.

## Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

```
CTF-Writeups/
├── Event-Name/ 
│ ├── Challenge-Name/ 
│ │ ├── README.md 
│ │ ├── solution.py 
│ │ └── ... 
│ └── ... 
├── Another-Event/ 
│ └── ... 
└── README.md
```

- `Event-Name/`: A directory for each CTF event or source of challenges (e.g., "ImaginaryCTF", "PicoCTF").
- `Challenge-Name/`: A subdirectory for each challenge, containing:
  - `writeup.md`: A markdown file describing the solution, steps taken, and any notable findings.
  - Additional files such as scripts (`solve.py`) or any other resources used during the challenge (if applicable).
